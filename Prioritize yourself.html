<h2><b>Start Prioritizing Yourself!</b></h2>
            <p>I know some of us might find it as difficult, but to other people they prioritize themselves all the time
                while other people don't. Taking care of yourself is like putting on your own oxygen mask first before helping others on a plane. 
                It's about looking out for number one so you can be your best for everyone else. Kinda like when you charge your phone before a big day
                 – you gotta recharge yourself too. Eat good food, get some sleep, and don't forget to do stuff that makes you happy, whether it's watching a show,
                  playing a game, or just chilling. It's not being selfish; it's like making sure your car has enough gas to go the distance. You matter, and taking 
                  care of yourself is like giving yourself a high-five for being awesome.








            </p>

            <p>Remember, it's okay to say "no" sometimes. You're not a superhero, and even superheroes need a break. If taking on extra stuff is like piling up too many bags at once, it's totally fine to say, "I can't carry all that right now." It's not about letting people down; it's about making sure you're not carrying more than you can handle. Just like your backpack has a limit, so do you.</p>

            <p>And don't forget the power of a good laugh. It's like a mini-vacation for your brain. Whether it's a funny video, a joke with friends, or just being goofy on your own, laughter is like a little reset button. So, when things get a bit much, throw in a joke, watch a funny cat video, or do whatever makes you crack a smile. It's like giving your mind a quick vacation – a chance to recharge and face whatever comes next with a grin.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, taking a step back is like hitting the pause button in a movie. It's okay to slow down and catch your breath. Life can be like a fast-paced song, but taking a moment to appreciate the quiet beats is important too. Whether it's a short walk, a few minutes of deep breathing, or just sitting with a cup of tea, it's like giving yourself a timeout to recalibrate. You're not missing out; you're just finding a balance.</p>

            <P>And hey, surround yourself with good vibes. It's like having a favorite song playing in the background of your day. Hang out with people who lift you up and make you feel awesome. It's not about having a huge crowd; it's about having those few pals who add positivity to your playlist of life. Just like a good song can turn your mood around, good company can make your day better. So, keep the good vibes flowing and let the positivity be your background melody.</P>
