<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
            <p><i>As a student like me I know some of you are stressed in academics 'cause some of you
                have your own responsibilities so that's why I decided to create a website just to all of you.
                I know sometimes we lost motivation to do what we need to do because no one motivates us.
                So that's why I am here to motivate all of you as I motivate myself.
            </i></p>

            <p>In this website I'll give you some motivations on how to prioritize your academics as you prioritize yourself.
                Yes, sometimes we are lazy to do our homeworks or activities that has been given to us because we are not using our
                time in a right way.
            </p>

            
                
            </style>
          </head>
          <body>
            <center><img src="Lazy.jpg" alt="I'm LAZY" width="150" height="120"></center>

            <p>As you can see above the picture shows of laziness, yes I do also feel it sometimes but I told to myself that laziness
                won't lead the way because it won't help me at the end of the day. I know if the laziness will overcome you, you would
                definitely cram alot. Someone would say "Cramming is LIFE" LOL!
            </p>

            <p>But that's not the right thing to do okay? If you cram alot it would cause stress and anxiety please don't let that happen
                I know being a student is tough but we can do this everyone! All of us have a bright future ahead so there's alot of steps we
                have to walk up and unlock those doors that has been waiting for us upstairs. All of us wants a bright future right? Spend
                time with our friends and love ones. But you need to have courage and motivations in order to that.
            </p>

            <p>And the purpose of this website is to motivate you guys to stop those laziness and start prioritizing our acads while 
                take caring of ourselves because we definitely need it everytime we face a new day everyday!
            </p>

            <center><img src="I'm Lazy later.jpg" alt="Later" width="150" height="120"></center>

            <p>Don't say this because it won't literally help you to be honest, because it will absolutely just cause 
                cramming 
            </p>

            <center><img src="I can do it.gif" alt="I can do it" width="150" height="120"></center>

            <p>Instead, just say <i><b>I CAN DO IT!</b></i> and I know a hundred percent you won't regret anything. I got you!</p>

            <p>So you'll see 2 more pages here on which will focus on how to prioritize your academics
                and the other one will focus on how to take good care of yourself.
                I really hope you all will like it 'cause I made this website just for you guys.
                I also wanted to help to those people who are lack of motivations to do anything so 
                let's start! Shall we?
            </p>
